File Format Map for Freeplane
=============================

a mindmap describing the Freeplane file format in detail across different program versions


scope
-----

- helps users and developers exploring the Freeplane file format
- should be rather detailled and formally correct
- will use attributes like "version : v1.2.x" for change identification
- will be viewable/addressable from the Freeplane index map
- can be filtered to see e.g. just the new formats of a certain revision
- can be used as a basis for export filter development



usage
-----

- clone repository
- load map into Freeplane
- do detailed adjustments
- push map (pull request)



TODO
----

- remove German expressions
- complete format details for Freeplane v1.2.x
- complete format details for Freeplane v1.3.x
- add (invisible) version attributes
- ...
